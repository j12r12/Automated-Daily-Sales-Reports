# Automated-Daily-Sales-Reports

This project allowed me to work on my object-oriented programming with Python while delivering a useful, time-saving report for daily use by my Senior Management Team.

I have used three different bespoke classes:

Daily_Data reads the data from the csv attachment sent over email and uses simple pivot tables to prepare the data to be graphed.

Graph takes this information and saves three figures for use in the Excel output file.

Excel brings both the data and graphs together to display the information in the format requested by my organisation. I used the very good xlsxwriter library to put this together.

This simple project solved a number of problems for my employers, in that it measured the daily sales completed by each salesperson, displayed this information in an easy-to-understand format and automated the whole process. This actually saved my line manager an hour of work per day, so he was quite pleased!
